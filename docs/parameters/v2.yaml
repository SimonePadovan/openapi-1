Etag:
  name: Etag
  description: |
    The RFC7232 ETag header field in a response provides the current entity-
    tag for the selected resource. An entity-tag is an opaque identifier for
    different versions of a resource over time, regardless whether multiple
    versions are valid at the same time. An entity-tag consists of an opaque
    quoted string, possibly prefixed by a weakness indicator.

  example: W/"xy", "5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"
  required: false
  type: string
IfMatch:
  name: If-Match
  description: |
    The RFC7232 If-Match header field in a request requires the server to
    only operate on the resource that matches at least one of the provided
    entity-tags. This allows clients express a precondition that prevent
    the method from being applied if there have been any changes to the
    resource.

  required: false
  example: '"5", "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70"'
  type: string
IfNoneMatch:
  name: If-None-Match
  description: |
    The RFC7232 If-None-Match header field in a request requires the server
    to only operate on the resource if it does not match any of the provided
    entity-tags. If the provided entity-tag is `*`, it is required that the
    resource does not exist at all.

  required: false
  example: '"7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70", *'
